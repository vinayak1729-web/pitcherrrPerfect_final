Vishal :==>
add the search filters to the teams for 5 teams u like , 

from dataset/teams.json 

take the team,team id to fetch it the drop down check list a
also add images to team name : ==> 

#@title Get Team Logo

# Pick single team ID to get logo for (default is 119 for Dodgers)
team_id = 119 # @param {type:"integer"}

# Get team logo using team_id
team_logo_url = f'https://www.mlbstatic.com/team-logos/{team_id}.svg'

# Display team logo (can change size if desired)
display(Image(url = team_logo_url, width=100, height=100))


for people in teams 
see use 3 apis keys 

parameter :==> season year 
user will select the year , then team name ( then u have to map team name with team id) and fetch it
https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/teams/{team_id}/roster?season={season_year}

then players roaster will be shown to u 

now add images to them 

#@title Get Player MLB.com Headshot

# Get current headshot for player using his player_id
player_current_headshot_url = f'https://securea.mlb.com/mlb/images/players/head_shot/{player_id}.jpg'

display(Image(url = player_current_headshot_url))
and here there will be a issue that only we can select the players of 1 team , to resolve it at a array datastcute to save the players in it temporay atmost 5 , and after saving all then save to database
give a btn while saving all btns 

in this question :==>

add the drop down of season  , home team drop dwon , and away team drop down
